# brand-new-note
  ## Description
  I used javascript to create the backend for a note-taker app. After creating routes to the html pages, I wrote functions to create and delete notes in the app. I struggled with getting Heroku to work and writing the file paths correctly but was able to get it to work after a while. Getting the app to 'delete' notes was another challenge I faced.
